I am a mathematics PhD Student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. I currently study on mathematics for image processing and art investigation under the supervision of Provessor [Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/Home.html). I began my PhD in 2022 and am funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

Before Cambridge, I was an undergraduate with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science at Duke University. I was priveledged to work with Professor [Ingrid Daubechies](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/ingrid.daubechies), where I began working on mathematics for image processing in collaboration with the [ARTICT](https://art-ict.github.io/artict/home.html) research group. This sparked my interest in the area of mathematics I currently study. While at Duke, I also explored projects in pure mathematics by publishing a senior thesis related to combinatorics and cohomology with Professor [Joseph Rabinoff](https://services.math.duke.edu/~jdr/) and through an ongoing project that started with Budapest Semesters in Mathematics with Dr. Attila Sali (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Attila-Sali).

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
